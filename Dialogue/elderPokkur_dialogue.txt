<true>First, let's talk about movement.
<true>You can move the active character by left-clicking with the left mouse button. 
<true>To change the active character, left-click on the character icon on the left. By checking the "follow" checkbox in the status window on the right, the first character in the party will be followed by the others.
<true>Next, let's talk about combat.
<true>You can enter combat by approaching an enemy or left-clicking on an enemy. 
<true>Right-click on a character to check the status of the enemy. Once pokkurs die, they will not be resurrected, so you need to think carefully about whether you have a chance of winning the battle.
<true>You should check other things yourself.
<false>I want you to make my dream come true.
<false>My life is not long now. I will die in a few days. Before I die, I want you to collect the orbs that exist in this world and bring them to me !
<false>First, you should fight the weak enemies and become strong.
<false>Remember, once you die, you do not come back to life. Of course, you will not have an infinite number of pokkurs.
<false>You should appreciate each and every one of pokkurs.
<false>And time is not infinite. If I die, this world will end... Hurry!!
